## SECTION B


### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

Personal safety is increasingly becoming a major concern in society today. Men and women of all ages are finding themselves in vulnerable situations on a daily basis. Whether it be walking home alone, lost in a new neighbourhood or simply going about day-to-day errands, everyone has experienced some level of stress due to their personal safety being compromised. Knowing that you’re carrying an application in your pocket that will provide help in an emergency, can bring peace of mind and relieve some stress when out and about alone in the world today.


### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

Protego is a cross-platform personal safety application. Built using the React Native framework, this cross-platform iOS and Android app will be designed for all to use. Users shall provide Protego with a list of their selected "guardians". These guardians will have access to the user's live location when they have communicated to Protego that they feel unsafe, by shouting a safeword aloud. The objective of this application is to make a difference in a person's life when they are feeling unsafe and are at risk,  by contacting those closest to them and allowing a user immediate contact with emergency services without having to remove their mobile phone from their pocket. 


### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

After a series of stories were shared online and on the news about people of all ages being in danger when alone in public, a discussion began amongst our peers. It became clear quite quickly that a large percentage had experienced something similar, often multiple times. We decided that we wanted to make a difference and that this application is a stepping stone on the right path.

When researching other safety apps, we discovered the DCU SafeZone Application. Although this app has some similarities, we felt that there could be further technologies developed in order to add additional levels of security. As well as that, the SafeZone app is primarily concerned with students while they’re on campus, however, after discussing the idea with some other students, we came to the conclusion that we are more at risk once we have left the DCU campus. Our aim is to provide a constant level of reassurance. 


### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

Protego will be developed for users of all ages. In terms of functionality, ideally we would develop the following:

- **Voice activated help button:** if a user suddenly felt at risk, they could simply say the safeword and SOS mode is activated.
- **Guardians:** a list of contacts who will be alerted should SOS mode be activated.
- **SOS mode:** can be triggered through voice activation or manually through the app. Once activated, the user’s live location is shared with the user’s guardians.
- **Password required OK button:** user must enter password to deactivate SOS mode. 
- **Camera:** users should be able to send live photos to guardians. 
- **Safe zones:** areas selected by the user.
- **Emergency call:** users can call emergency services, possibly a voice activated option.
- **Fake call:** plays ringtone to simulate receiving a phone call for easy exit from an uncomfortable situation.
- **User profile:** to edit details provided and list of guardians.
- **Phone number authentication:** on registration, to ensure new account. 
- **Multiple language options**: users can change app language if desired.


### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

Protego has the ability to become extremely useful in a user’s life should they find themselves at risk. Possible scenarios include:

- Walking to/from home 
- Outside after dark
- Taxi journeys
- Travelling alone
- Lost in unfamiliar neighbourhood


### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

Javascript


### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.


- React Native Framework
- React Native CLI 
- Android Studio
- XCode
- Git
- Firebase(Real-time Database, Authentication, Storage)
- React Library
- JEST (testing framework)
- yarn/npm (js package manager)


### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

- iOS device for testing
- Android device for testing


### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.


- Current working knowledge of developing android applications but not using the React Native framework.
- Minimal experience of Javascript between us. 
- No previous experience developing iOS applications.
- Minimal knowledge of developing a testing system.


### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.

For the duration of this project, we plan on using a project management tool such as Asana or Trello to keep track of what is currently being developed and what tasks still need to be carried out. Tasks will be divided with the desire that each of us will complete tasks within various elements of the project, meaning each student will gain first hand experience for each element of the applications architecture. Mainly communication will be through a messaging platform, along with a weekly Zoom meeting to discuss the work face-to-face. 


In terms of documentation, equal responsibility should be taken. 


#### Student 1 - Emma

> *Student 1 should complete this section.*

I plan on focusing mainly on the development and testing of the iOS application. I work on a MacBook and because iOS applications are unable to be tested on Windows computers, we felt this makes sense. As well as that, I own an iPhone that I can use for testing the iOS application.
I will be communicating with Mikolaj throughout the project in an effort to ensure the iOS application I am working on matches with the Android version he is implementing. I will also be ensuring Mikolaj is aware of my iOS development for the purpose that he may be able to help with debugging, should it be necessary. 

#### Student 2 - Mikolaj

> *Student 2 should complete this section.*

I will take care of the duties related to the Android section of this app. I will work on my Windows machine and test the android version using an emulator and also by using my Android mobile device. I will be communicating with Emma frequently to make sure that we are working on the correct aspects of the application.
